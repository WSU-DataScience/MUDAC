### Details

**Limit on the number of teams**

We have room for 35 teams and registration is first-come-first-serve.  If more
than 35 teams register, we will keep a waiting list and teams on the waiting
list will be invited to the competition as spots become available (due to
cancellation or a lack of payment).  Note that, historically, the 35
team slots tend to fill fairly quickly.

Due to our limited capacity, we have a restriction of two teams per academic
program, but schools can petition for a third team, which might be invited as
room permits.  Contact <mudac@winona.edu> for more information.

**Registration Details**

Only ONE representative from each team should register (preferably team
advisor). An advisor representing up to two teams can register both
teams. To register and pay, click on *Tickets* on the [MUDAC registration page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2018-mudac-team-registration-tickets-43136189504).

#### When will registration open?

Registration will be open March 1st and close on March 28th or until filled.

#### Can you give me some more details about registration?

Registration is first-come-first-serve.  If more than 35 teams register, we will
keep a waiting list and teams on the waiting list will be invited to the
competition as spots become available (due to cancellation or a lack of payment).
Note that, historically, the 35 team slots tend to fill fairly quickly.

#### Is there a limit to the number of teams from a given school?

Yes, we have a limit of 2 teams per program, but schools can
petition for a third team, which might be invited as room permits.  Contact
<mudac@winona.edu> for more information.

#### Where can I register?

A link to the registration page will be provided here after registration starts.

#### How much will it cost?

The cost of registration is $50 per team.  You must pay for registration before
Wednesday March 28th.

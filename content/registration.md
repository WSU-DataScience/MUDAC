## When will registration open?

Registration is open through March 28th or until filled.  You can
register at the [MUDAC registration page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2018-mudac-team-registration-tickets-43136189504)

## Can you give me some more details about registration?

**Limit on the number of teams**

We have room for 35 teams and registration is first-come-first-serve.  If more
than 35 teams register, we will keep a waiting list and teams on the waiting
list will be invited to the competition as spots become available (due to
cancellation or a lack of payment).  Note that, historically, the 35
team slots tend to fill fairly quickly.

Due to our limited capacity, we have a restriction of two teams per academic
program, but schools can petition for a third team, which might be invited as
room permits.  Contact <mudac@winona.edu> for more information.

**Registration Details**

Only ONE representative from each team should register (preferably team
advisor). An advisor representing up to two teams can register both
teams. To register and pay, click on *Tickets* on the [MUDAC registration page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2018-mudac-team-registration-tickets-43136189504).
Complete registration and payment as directed.

The cost of registration is $50 per team.  You must pay for registration before
Wednesday March 28th.  **We prefer payment by credit card.** However, if paying by
check, payment must be recieved before March 28, 2018.  Make checks payable to *WSU Foundation: MUDAC*.

**Cancellation/Refund Policy**

2018, however, no refunds will be issued.
